# FLOTO

FLOTO is a measurement instrument built with the purpose of collecting data from sensors, anywhere that you want. You can read more about the project on [our website](https://internetequity.org/floto/).

Users on FLOTO come in many types. Some manage device deployments, some write applications to collect data, and some are interested in using the data collections.
