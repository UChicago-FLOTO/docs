# Device Operator Overview

Device operators manage the deployment of FLOTO devices. They can use the [FLOTO dashboard](https://portal.floto.science) to do so.

## Enrolling a new device.

Contact us to enroll a new device. We will provide details of how to flash an OS on it.

Once your device is networking, please coordinate with us to assign it to your project to ensure proper authorization is set up for its usage.

## Using the Dashboard

On the dashboard, first navigate to the "Devices" page to see all devices. Select the "wrench" icon next to a device to see its overview. This will let you see various properties about the device, including its MAC and IP addresses. It also shows the device environment variables. There are two additional tabs, the first is the "Command" tab, which lets you run one off commands on the device. The next is the "Logs" tab, which shows the last 1000 lines of logs from the device.
