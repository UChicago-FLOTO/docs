# User documentation


## Getting started

To get access to the FLOTO infrastructure, first visit the [dashboard], and then sign in with Globus Auth. This will allow you to select an organization login (typically your intitution) or via Google. 

After doing this, you'll need to be granted approved to use FLOTO. To request this, please send a message to contact@floto.science from the email you signed up with. 

You'll also need a project to use FLOTO. If you need a new project, please mention this during your initial message. If you are collaborating with group already using FLOTO, the PI of that group will be able to add you to it.

Once granted access, you only be able to access devices that device operators have either made public, or given you access to. You will be able to browse the list of all devices, and filter by devices you operate and the ones you can deploy applications to.

## Next steps
