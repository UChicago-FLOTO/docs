# Managing users

Any user can sign in to the dashboard with their federated credentials.

Users are approved to use FLOTO via the dashboard's [admin interface](https://portal.floto.science/admin/floto_auth/keycloakuser/). "Approved to use floto" means in the Keycloak, the account is added to the admin group. "Staff" and "Superuser" status refer to a user being able to access the `/admin` pages on the dashboard.

To approve users, select their entry and then under the "Action" dropdown pick "Approve account" and then select "Go".
